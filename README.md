# State-of-the-art in reversible logic synthesis

## Overview

![Overview](data/overview.png)

We classify reversible synthesis algorithms using 4 levels of categorization:

1. **Reversiblity of the input**: we distinguish between nonreversible and reversible functions.  Embedding is not part of this categorization and need to be applied as a preprocess if needed. Columns in the overview figure refer to this level.
2. **Manipulation of the input**: if the synthesis algorithm modifies the input during execution or emphasizes on the underlying function of the input rather than its structure, we refer to the synthesis approaches as *functional synthesis*, otherwise as *structural synthesis*.  Functional synthesis algorithms guarantee optimum lines during synthesis and may also allow optimum number of gates. Rows in the overview figure refer to this level.
3. **Algorithm**: For each category several algorithms may be proposed which differ in their conceptual methodology. Items in boxes refer to this level.
4. **Implementation**: Each algorithm can be implemented in several different ways using several different data structures for the input representation.  This level is not visible in the overview figure but discussed in the following text.

## Gate libraries

### NCT (Not, CNOT, Toffoli)

| NOT                  | CNOT                   | Toffoli                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ![NOT](data/not.png) | ![CNOT](data/cnot.png) | ![Toffoli](data/toffoli.png) |

The NCT library consists of the three gates NOT, CNOT, and Toffoli.  The Toffoli gate is a double-controlled NOT gate. These gates are universal in a sense, that every Boolean function can be realized if an arbitrary number of variables (lines) is permitted.  Given *n* variables, the NCT gate library can realize all permutations over *n* ≤ 3 variables and all even permutations over *n* > 3 variables.

## Synthesis algorithms

### Functional exact methods
Exact synthesis methods guarantee minimality in number of gates (time) and number of lines (space).

#### SAT-based synthesis
Given a truth table of a Boolean function *f*, the decision problem “*Does there exist a reversible circuit with k gates that represents f?*” is translated into a SAT problem. A circuit can be extracted from a satisfying assignment to the problem. Asking the question, starting from *k* being 0 and incrementing it until the problem is satisfiable, gives the gate-optimum circuit.

### Functional heuristic methods
Functional heuristic synthesis methods guarantee minimality in number of lines (space).

#### Transformation-based synthesis
Given a truth table of a Boolean function, transformation-based synthesis applies gates and adjusts the truth table accordingly in a way that each gate application gets the truth table closer to the identity function.  If the identity function has been reached, all applied gates make up for the circuit that realizes the initial function.

#### Decomposition-based methods

### Structural methods
Structural methods do neither guarantee optimality for number of gates nor for number of lines.
